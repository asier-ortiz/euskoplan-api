[{"fechaActualizacion":"11/04/2024 09:22:33","datosGenerales":{"codigo":"4981","tipoRecurso":"D2","nombre":"Bilbao","descripcion":"<p><strong>Bilbao</strong> is the most cosmopolitan, crowded and bustling of the basque cities. It is a chameleon-like city, which has managed to reinvent itself over the past two decades, completely transforming both its character as well as its appearance. Yet this has not prevented the city from preserving the charm and charisma of its old nooks and crannies. The name of the city is and will undoubtedly be linked to the spectacular <strong>Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao</strong>, designed by Frank O. Gehry and which has brought him such international fame. But <em>Botxo</em> (that's how it is popularly known) is much more than that: over the years it has become an appealing tourist destination, with a wide range on offer in terms of culture, business and cuisine.    Modern buildings such as the<strong>Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall</strong> (headquarters for international conferences and important cultural events), the <strong>Isozaki Atea Towers</strong>, the <strong>Bilbao Exhibition Centre</strong> in Barakaldo or <strong>La Paloma Airport</strong>, in Loiu, have helped to provide a structure for a new Bilbao, which competes with big cities in terms of quality and modernity. There&iquest;s no chance of getting bored in this town. So, those who love going for a stroll have a wide range of interesting tours to choose from, and an absolute must to visit is the unique <strong>Old Quarter</strong> (also known by the name of the <strong>Seven Streets</strong>), whose narrow streets are dotted with a bounty of classic and innovative bars, restaurants and shops, the<strong>Gran V&iacute;a</strong>, shopping and banking artery of the city, where international firms and local businesses converge, and the area of <strong>Abandoibarra</strong>, next to the river. Also, <strong>Vizcaya Bridge</strong>, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and which joins both banks of the river as it passes through Portugalete and Las Arenas, is one of the emblems of Greater Bilbao. The diversity of museums is another hallmark that identifies the town. As well as the Guggenheim, the <strong>Fine Arts museum</strong>, <strong>ethnographic museum</strong>, <strong>reproductions museum</strong>, <strong>bullfighting museum</strong>, <strong>archaeology museum</strong> and the <strong>maritime museum</strong> are highlighted. There is even a museum devoted to <strong>Athletic de Bilbao</strong> football club. During the summertime, music takes on a special importance, through the organization of festivals such as <strong>BBKLive</strong> or <strong>Kobetasonik</strong>, which brings together leading artists. Not forgetting the festive atmosphere that permeates through each and every corner of the city during the <strong>Aste Nagusia</strong> or the annual Semana Grande summer festival. Bilbao is, in short, a metropolis with its own flair and distinction, committed to modernity without turning its back on its most deeply-rooted traditions.</p>","urlFichaPortal":"https://tourism.euskadi.eusen/top10/towns/bilbao/aa30-12376/en/","localizacion":{"codigoProvincia":"48","codigoMunicipio":"020","codigoLocalidad":"14802000000011","nombreProvincia":"Bizkaia","nombreMunicipio":"Bilbao","nombreLocalidad":"Bilbao"},"georeferenciacion":{"gmLongitud":"-2.923446364418055","gmLatitud":"43.256961046580166"}},"datosLocalidades":{"numHabitantes":"342662","superficie":"41.30"},"galeria":[{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000004981_d2_rec_turismo/en_4981/images/GL_bilbao1.jpg","titulo":"Guggenheim Bilbao Museum"},{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000004981_d2_rec_turismo/en_4981/images/GL_MuseoGuggenheimaraaMamanBurgeois1.jpg","titulo":"Guggenheim Bilbao Museum"},{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000004981_d2_rec_turismo/en_4981/images/GL_ayuntamientodebilbaocityhall.jpg","titulo":"Bilbao Town Council "},{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000004981_d2_rec_turismo/en_4981/images/GL_TeatroArriagaAsteNagusia.jpg","titulo":"Arriaga Theatre in Bilbao "},{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000004981_d2_rec_turismo/en_4981/images/GL_cascoViejoBilbaoAldeZaharra.jpg","titulo":"Bilbao Old Town"},{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000004981_d2_rec_turismo/en_4981/images/GL_gugennheim_museoa.jpg","titulo":"Guggenheim Bilbao Museum"}]},{"fechaActualizacion":"22/03/2024 11:55:37","datosGenerales":{"codigo":"5021","tipoRecurso":"D2","nombre":"Astigarraga","descripcion":"<p>The river Urumea runs around this locality. We are talking about Astigarraga, <strong>the home of cider</strong>, located just a few kilometres from <strong>San Sebasti&aacute;n</strong>.</p><p>The town comprises two distinct areas. Down in the area around the river Urumea, the main town centre is located on the lands that were once controlled by the lords of Murguia. Up the town, in the current neighbourhood of Santiago, the buildings are spread over the Santiagomendi mountainside, on the summit where there is a <strong>chapel dedicated to St. James the Apostle</strong>. Paying a visit this modest church on the St. James&#39; Way is a good excuse to enjoy some of the most unbeatable views from the summit. Next to the original chapel we find another great point of interest, the <strong>Santiagomendi Environmental School-Hostel.</strong></p><p>Also deserving special mention is the Santiagomendi ethnographic park. This is a set of traditional farm tools and animal-powered transport.</p><p>The parish of <strong>Santa Mar&iacute;a de la Asunci&oacute;n</strong> (also known Santa Mar&iacute;a de Murgia), built on the top of the hill known today as Markesmendi, is another must-see spot for the visitor. It is a small church built in hewn worked stone, in the shape of a Latin cross with a nave comprising two rectangular sections. Next to the church stands Murgia palace. It is a remarkable rectangular building and has a ground floor and is three storeys high, with a hip roof. It retains much of the old hewn stone walls. Some years ago the private garden, landscaped in a Roman style opened its doors to the public.</p><p><strong>Cider Capital</strong></p><p>But, above all, <strong>Astigarraga </strong>is famous because of its cider; this area is full of apple trees thanks to its climate and its lands&#39; favourable conditions. Nowadays the cider industry is growing and dinners in the cider breweries have become very popular, especially during the cider season (from mid-January to the end of March). Guests will enjoy a delicious cider menu consisting of codfish omelet, fried codfish with green peppers, grilled T-bone steak and cheese with quince and nuts. Obviously, all accompanied with delicious cider.</p><p>As an essential accompaniment to this varied gastronomic offer, the <strong>Sagardoetxea </strong>(Cider House) of Astigarraga offers visitors the chance to get to know the production of this natural drink. The museum includes an apple plantation, an interpreting centre, tasting area and cider tasting.</p><p>On another note, all those who visit the town in July will have the chance to experience the annual local festivals held between 24th 26th July in honour of St. James&#39; the Apostle. Another good day to enjoy Astigarraga is on 15th May, the feast day of San Isidro, a day on which the busy, bustling fair is held in the neighbourhood of Benta.</p>","urlFichaPortal":"https://tourism.euskadi.eusen/towns/astigarraga/aa30-12375/en/","localizacion":{"codigoProvincia":"20","codigoMunicipio":"903","codigoLocalidad":"12090300000010","nombreProvincia":"Gipuzkoa","nombreMunicipio":"Astigarraga","nombreLocalidad":"Astigarraga"},"georeferenciacion":{"gmLongitud":"-1.947645730688464","gmLatitud":"43.28066802127562"}},"datosLocalidades":{"numHabitantes":"4709","superficie":"17.16"},"galeria":[{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000005021_d2_rec_turismo/en_5021/images/GL_MuseodelasidraSagardoetxeaenAstigarraga3.jpg","titulo":"Astigarraga"},{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000005021_d2_rec_turismo/en_5021/images/GL_ASTI_ELIZA_2.jpg","titulo":"Astigarraga"},{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000005021_d2_rec_turismo/en_5021/images/GL_ASTI_UDALA.jpg","titulo":"Astigarraga"}]},{"fechaActualizacion":"09/01/2024 14:10:23","datosGenerales":{"codigo":"5024","tipoRecurso":"D2","nombre":"Salvatierra/Agurain","descripcion":"<p>Located in the historical territory of Alava, Salvatierra/Agurain belongs to the homonym municipality.</p><p>It is placed between the Entzia and Iturrieta Mountain Ranges, with spectacular beech woods, and is formed by five towns among which Salvatierra/Agurain stands out, as it is the administrative capital of the area and has a medieval old part surrounded by a wall.

And the capital of Alava is one of those cities that has a rich historical and artistic heritage, an endless number of landscaped areas, pedestrian areas, ideal for leisure and civic facilities. An accessible, unique city with flair and distinction.    One of its most precious and best kept treasures is the <strong>old quarter</strong>, originating in the Middle Ages and unique in the Basque Country for the abundance of Renaissance and Romanesque mansions. The \"Medieval Almond\" (nickname for what is known as the old quarter) houses very interesting religious buildings such as the churches of San Pedro and San Vicente or the parish of San Miguel; but, without a shadow of a doubt, the most well-known jewel is the <strong>Cathedral of Santa Maria</strong> or <strong>Old Cathedral</strong>. This church served as inspiration for the novel<em>A World without End</em> by <strong>Ken Follett&nbsp;</strong>and has launched Vitoria onto the international arena. The initiative known as \"Open for works\" enables tourists to visit the restoration of the building. The expansion that took place in the nineteenth century is now a convenient pedestrian area, main shopping area and complete with superb vantage points. Natural parks of great ecological and scenic value make up the <strong>\"Green Belt\"</strong> that surrounds the capital of Alava. Wetlands (that serve as beaches during the summertime), forests, grasslands, rivers and fields offer visitors the opportunity to go on trips, do outdoor sports and to observe the many species of birds. Vitoria-Gasteiz will be the <strong>European Green Capital</strong> of 2012. The festive and cultural calendar of events in the city is very broad and diverse. So, the long-running <strong>International Jazz Festival</strong>, the <strong>Azkena Rock Festival</strong> and the <strong>International Theatre Festival</strong> are three of the most renowned events celebrated in Vitoria. Local festivals are another great appeal in this city, as demonstrated by the huge festivals in honour of the <strong>Virgen Blanca</strong>, the feast of <strong>San Prudencio</strong> and the pilgrimage to <strong>Olarizu</strong>. Similarly, Vitoria is home to many museums: the <strong>Artium</strong> or Basque Museum Centre of Contemporary Art, the Museum of <strong>Fine Arts</strong> or the <strong>Bibat</strong>, a merger of the Playing Cards and Archaeology museums. Those with a sweet-tooth have another good reason to visit Vitoria. Not surprisingly, <strong>patisseries</strong> and<strong>cake shops</strong> of prestige sell exquisite own products, such as Confiter&iacute;a Goya cake shop, craftsmen who make the famous chocolates known locally as \"Vasquitos\" and \"Nesquitas\". From Vitoria we can visit the region of <strong>Rioja Alavesa</strong>, known throughout the world for its excellent wines and wineries.</p>","urlFichaPortal":"https://tourism.euskadi.eusen/top10/towns/vitoria-gasteiz/aa30-12376/en/","localizacion":{"codigoProvincia":"01","codigoMunicipio":"059","codigoLocalidad":"10105900000018; 10105900000765; 10105900000044; 10105900000060; 10105900000076; 10105900000082; 10105900000095; 10105900000116; 10105900000121; 10105900000137; 10105900000155; 10105900000168; 10105900000180; 10105900000207; 10105900000214; 10105900000229; 10105900000235; 10105900000240; 10105900000266; 10105900000291; 10105900000305; 10105900000312; 10105900000333; 10105900000348; 10105900000351; 10105900000364; 10105900000370; 10105900000386; 10105900000399; 10105900000403; 10105900000410; 10105900000431; 10105900000446; 10105900000459; 10105900000462; 10105900000484; 10105900000497; 10105900000500; 10105900000517; 10105900000522; 10105900000538; 10105900000543; 10105900000556; 10105900000569; 10105900000575; 10105900000581; 10105900000594; 10105900000608; 10105900000615; 10105900000620; 10105900000636; 10105900000641; 10105900000654; 10105900000667; 10105900000673; 10105900000689; 10105900000692; 10105900000706; 10105900000713; 10105900000728; 10105900000734; 10105900000749; 10105900000752; 10105900000023","nombreProvincia":"Araba/Álava","nombreMunicipio":"Vitoria-Gasteiz","nombreLocalidad":"Abetxuko; Zumeltzu; Ehari/Ali; Amarita; Andollu; Antezana/Andetxa; Arangiz; Arkauti/Arcaute; Arkaia; Aretxabaleta; Argandoña; Ariñiz/Aríñez; Armentia; ; Artatza Foronda; Askartza; Astegieta; Berrostegieta; Betoño; Castillo/Gaztelu; Zerio; Krispiña/ Crispijana | Krispiña / Crispijana; Elorriaga; Eskibel; Estarrona; Foronda; Gamarra Mayor/Gamarra Nagusia; Gamarra Menor/Gamarra Gutxia; Gamiz; Gardelegi; Gobeo; Gometxa; Gereña; Hueto Abajo/Otobarren; Otogoien/Hueto Arriba; Ilarratza; Jungitu; Lasarte; Legarda; Lermanda; Lopidana; Lubiano; Mandojana; Margarita; Martioda; Matauko; Mendiguren; Mendiola; Mendoza; Miñao/Miñano Mayor; Miñano Menor/Miñao Gutxia; Monasterioguren; Oreitia; Otazu; Erretana; Subijana de Álava/Subillana-Gasteiz | Subijana de Alava/Subillana-Gasteiz; Ullibarri de los Olleros/Uribarri Nagusia; Uribarri Arrazua; Ullibarri-Viña/Uribarri-Dibiña; Villafranca; Vitoria-Gasteiz; Yurre/Ihurre; Zuazo de Vitoria/Zuhatzu; Aberasturi"},"georeferenciacion":{"gmLongitud":"-2.6716350000000375","gmLatitud":"42.84676126365027"}},"datosLocalidades":{"numHabitantes":"238911","superficie":"276.80"},"galeria":[{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000005081_d2_rec_turismo/en_5081/images/GL_vitoriagasteiz.jpg","titulo":"Vitoria-Gasteiz"},{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000005081_d2_rec_turismo/en_5081/images/GL_gasteizantiguamuralla_mural.jpg","titulo":"Old wall"},{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000005081_d2_rec_turismo/en_5081/images/GL_gasteiz_escultura_ken_follet.jpg","titulo":"Ken Follet"},{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000005081_d2_rec_turismo/en_5081/images/GL_gasteiz_plaza.jpg","titulo":"New Square"}]},{"fechaActualizacion":"08/05/2024 11:57:42","datosGenerales":{"codigo":"5101","tipoRecurso":"D2","nombre":"San Sebastián","descripcion":"<p>Beautiful, elegant, exquisite, charming and majestic. That's<strong>San Sebastian</strong>, a city located in the Basque Coast, open to the sea and considered by many to be the tourist capital of the Basque Country. It's home to one of the most beautiful cities&nbsp;bays in the world, called&nbsp;<strong>La Concha</strong>, and three urban beaches (<strong>La Concha</strong>, <strong>Zurriola</strong> and <strong>Ondarreta</strong>). San Sebastian is surrounded by hills and vantage points (Igeldo, Urgull, Ulia and the Island of Santa Clara) and linked by the river Urumea.    The city centre, which is home to such characteristic buildings like the Victoria Eugenia Theatre, Hotel Mar&iacute;a Cristina, the Town Hall or the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd, has maintained its <strong>romantic aura</strong>over the years. Not surprisingly, San Sebastian was a place that was regularly frequented by the European aristocracy during the Belle Epoque. The old buildings coexist alongside new and modern architecture, such as the<strong>Kursaal</strong>centre, designed by Rafael Moneo or the renowned<strong><em>Wind Comb</em></strong> by Chillida, an icon very closely linked to San Sebastian. The <strong>Old Quarter</strong> is the heart of the city and brings together numerous landmark buildings (the Basilica of Santa Mar&iacute;a del Coro, for example) and is an ideal place to enjoy the renowned cuisine and the delicious San Sebastian pintxos. We cannot forget that this is the city with the most Michelin stars per square metre. The very best raw materials are readily available at the traditional markets. For those who love<strong>walking</strong> the parks and gardens in San Sebastian can be toured both on foot as well as by bicycle, as well as enjoying walks along the promenade (from the Wind Comb to the Kursaal), outdoors in nature. The city is great for shopping and leisure and the vibrant cultural life is one of its greatest assets. Every year shining stars make their way to the <strong>International Film Festival</strong>, to the delight of savvy autograph-hunters.

In addition to this, Hernani is an important enclave within the Road to Santiago. The Fagollaga Bridge and the edible jug of Santa Cruz are some of the most significant monuments to find on the road. It is also worth visiting the hermitage of Santa Barbara, which offers a gorgeous scenery of the Urumea and Oria Valleys.</p><p><strong>Chillida-Leku Museum</strong></p><p>Located in the surroundings of the Zabalaga farmhouse, in Jauregi neighbourhood, the <strong>Chillida-Leku Museum</strong> holds amazing sculptures of great sculptor Eduardo Chillida. The museum is divided into three areas: A 12-hectare hillside with over 40 sculptures. A service area featuring an auditorium, a rest area, and a gift shop. And finally, the centrepiece of the museum is the Zabalaga Farmhouse, which houses the smaller format pieces made with different materials.</p><p>Finally, Hernani celebrates its patron Saint festival honouring San Juan Bautista on June 23rd-27th. There are many interesting scheduled events during those days such as the &quot;Azeridantza,&quot; which is a deeply rooted local game. This municipality is also known for its traditional cider making, which attracts numerous visitors.</p>","urlFichaPortal":"https://tourism.euskadi.eusen/towns/hernani/aa30-12375/en/","localizacion":{"codigoProvincia":"20","codigoMunicipio":"040","codigoLocalidad":"12004000000180; 12004000000121; 12004000000137; 12004000000142; 12004000000155; 12004000000168; 12004000000076; 12004000000057; 12004000000044; 12004000000220; 12004000000109","nombreProvincia":"Gipuzkoa","nombreMunicipio":"Hernani","nombreLocalidad":"Akerregi; Martindegi; Osinaga | Diseminado; Pagoaga | Diseminado; Santa Barbara | Diseminado; Zikuñaga; Hernani; Ereñotzu; Epela | Diseminado; Eziago | Diseminado; Jauregi | Sorgintxulo"},"georeferenciacion":{"gmLongitud":"-1.975814","gmLatitud":"43.267549"}},"datosLocalidades":{"numHabitantes":"19285","superficie":"42.00"},"galeria":[{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000007381_d2_rec_turismo/en_7381/images/GL_hernaini1.jpg","titulo":"Hernani"},{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000007381_d2_rec_turismo/en_7381/images/GL_hernani2.jpg","titulo":"Hernani "},{"src":"https://www.opendata.euskadi.eus/contenidos/d_destinos_turisticos/0000007381_d2_rec_turismo/en_7381/images/GL_hernani3.jpg","titulo":"Hernani "}]},{"fechaActualizacion":"15/09/2023 11:31:06","datosGenerales":{"codigo":"7401","tipoRecurso":"D2","nombre":"Valdegovía","descripcion":"<p>The municipality of Valdegov&iacute;a is located in the western area of the historical territory of <strong>Alava </strong>and belongs to the Cuadrilla de A&ntilde;ana.

The mining industry has marked both the development and the very form of the municipality, which is divided into two distinct parts: the Zona Alta, where the mining neighbourhoods are, and the Zona Baja, the urban centre where most of the population and amenities are to be found.    As a consequence of the Triano railway, created in the late 19th century, mining activity suffered an amazing development, so that many people settled at the highest part of the valley. Nowadays, we can still find remains of this activity (Pe&ntilde;amora Mine, La Arboleda and La Reineta...), moreover, many of these areas have been converted in leisure areas. For example, former mines were flooded and today they are small artificial lakes, ideal for fishing. <strong>La Arboleda and La Reineta funicular railway</strong> La Arboleda, for instance, provides several leisure areas, a hostel belonging to the Regional Council of Bizkaia, some sports facilities and many restaurants where visitors will taste the best local gastronomy. Not further, the Interpretation Centre Pe&ntilde;as Negras offers information about routes to be covered in the surroundings. A way for reaching this area is the singular La Reineta funicular railway. Founded in 1926, it is the only one in Spain whose cars go up and down horizontally. La Reineta funicular railway leads us to the homonym neighbourhood, just one kilometre from La Arboleda. From this point visitors will enjoy beautiful views of Bilbao's El Abra port. On the other hand, in the main urban area of Valle de Tr&aacute;paga, we must mention some interesting buildings dating from the late 19th c. and the beginning of the 20th. The neo-Romanesque church of Transfiguraci&oacute;n del Se&ntilde;or (1930) has a Latin-cross plan, three naves, tower and a portico. The churches of San Jos&eacute; Obrero &iquest;in neo-Romanesque style- and San Juan Bautista &iquest;neo-classical and with one nave- are also worth a visit. Relating to civil architecture, we cannot miss the neo-classical town hall built in the first decade of the 20th century, and the Olaso Palace, a copy of another gothic palace that the Olaso family built in Bergara in the 16th century.
