# Euskoplan API

Backend in REST API format created in Laravel for the [Euskoplan Client](https://github.com/asier-ortiz/euskoplan-client) project.

It allows the creation and management of tourism plans using various catalogs from the [Open Data Euskadi](https://opendata.euskadi.eus/inicio/) website in XML format as data sources. This information is updated in the project's database through a parser and a Cron job.

It uses the Mapbox API to calculate the itinerary route and manages authorization and authentication using [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sanctum) and [Laravel Gates](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/authorization#gates).
